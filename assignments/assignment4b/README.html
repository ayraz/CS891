<h3>Android AsyncTask Framework and Synchronizers (Assignment 4 - Part B)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objectives of Part B of this assignment are to learn how to
synchronize Android AsyncTasks via a readers-writer lock (Java
StampedLock) and a semaphore (implemented using your solution to <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment3b/">assignment
3b</a>).  Videos describing Java StampedLocks appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QER63oNLpAE&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=51">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ywEZ9sZSU&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=52">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand Java
StampedLocks.  Naturally, this topic is covered in class, as
well. </P>

<P>In this part of the assignment you will use a semaphore and a Java
StampedLock to enhance the AsyncTask/ThreadPoolExecutor implementation
of the PalantiriSimulator app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment4a/">Assignment
3A</A>. Assignment 4B focuses on the PalantiriManager, which is used
to restrict the number of beings from Middle-Earth who can
concurrently gaze into a fixed number of palantiri. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project in Android
Studio version 3.3.  This app is written in both Kotlin and Java and
demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.

For the purposes of Assignment 3B, however, you only need to be aware
of the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/">app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of JUnit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/asyncTask">asyncTask</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment4a/">Assignment
3A</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>asyncTask</CODE> skeleton and
use it as implementation of the BeingManager for Assignment 4B. </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 24, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 24. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks!!!  In particular, you'll need to
finish implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore">stampedLockFairSemaphore</A> folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/stampedLockFairSemaphoreMgr.java">stampedLockFairSemaphoreMgr.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to implement a
PalantiriManager via a fair semaphore, a StampedLock, and a HashMap.
</P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/FairSemaphore.java">FairSemaphore.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to implement a
counting semaphore using a built-in Java monitor object. </P>
</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing beings to the number of palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four palantiri in the simulation, then only four beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show palantiri and being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct and does not throw any exceptions the app title bar labels
will appear green when the simulation completes. If the implementation
throws an exception or is not implemented correctly when the
simulation completes the red title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<H4>Additional "TO DO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must perform the following additional task(s):</P>

<UL>

<LI> Enhance the <CODE>StampedLockFairSemaphoreMgr.java</CODE> file
to use Java 8 features in several places.

</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these Java 8 enhancements,
but it's not required.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment4b/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This part of the assignment is designed to get you familiar with
synchronizing multi-threaded programs using Java 8 StampedLocks, which
are more powerful (and sometimes more efficient) than the spin-locks
and ReentrantLocks we covered in previous assignments. </P>
