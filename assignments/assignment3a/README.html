<h3>Java ExecutorCompletionService Framework, Java ConcurrentHashMap, and Fair Semaphore (Assignment 3 - Part A)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objective of Part A of this assignment is to learn how to use
the Java ExecutorCompletionService framework.  Videos describing this
framework appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bl9GyGf4qs&index=49&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIeqBOFPz6I&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=50">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand the Java
ExecutorCompletionService.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in
class, as well.

In this part of the assignment you will use an instance of the Java
ExecutorCompletionService class that's associated with a "cached" pool
of threads to enhance the fixed-sized thread pool implementation of
the PalantiriSimulator app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a/">Assignment
2A</A>. Assignment 3A focuses on creating a cached pool of threads
that allow beings to concurrently gaze into a given number of
palantiri.

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project in Android
Studio version 3.3.  This app is written in both Kotlin and Java and
demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.

For the purposes of Assignment 3A, however, you only need to be aware
of the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService">app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of JUnit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your enhanced solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore">reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment2b/">Assignment
2B</a> and use it as implementation of the PalantiriManager for
Assignment 3A (make sure to address all my comments from Assignment 2B
in your Assignment 3A solution). </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 24, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 24. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks!!!  In particular, you'll need to
finish implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService">completionService</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService/ExectorCompletionServiceMgr.java">ExectorCompletionServiceMgr.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a BeingManager via a cached thread pool using the Java
ExecutorService and ExecutorCompletionService. </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService/BeingCallable.java">BeingCallable.java</A>.
You'll need to complete a couple of methods in this class, which
should look very familiar by now.  </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Assignment.java">Assignment.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>sTypes</CODE>
field to either <CODE>GRADUATE</CODE> or <CODE>UNDERGRADUATE</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing beings to the number of palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four palantiri in the simulation, then only four beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show palantiri and being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct and does not throw any exceptions the app title bar labels
will appear green when the simulation completes. However, red title
bar labels will be displayed when the simulation completes if the
implementation throws an exception or is not implemented
correctly.</P>

<H4>Additional "TO DO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must perform the following additional task(s):</P>

<UL>

<LI> Enhance the <CODE>ExecutorCompletionServiceMgr.java</CODE> file
to use Java 8 method references and/or lambda expressions as
instructed.

</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods/features, but
it's not required.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This part of the assignment is designed to deepen your knowledge of
writing concurrent Java programs using a thread pool in conjunction
with the Java ExecutorCompletionService, which enhances the Java
ExecutorService mechanisms we covered in Assignment 2A.  It doesn't
require you to program any Android concurrency/communication
frameworks (which we'll cover in upcoming assignments). </P>
